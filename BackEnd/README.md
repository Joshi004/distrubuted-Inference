```

## 🚀 Quick Start (Current System)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (for fetch support)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) installed locally
- Llama3 model: `ollama pull llama3`

### Installation
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd ai-inference-platform
npm install
```

### Running the System
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the AI processor
npm run start:processor

# Terminal 2: Start the gateway service  
npm run start:gateway

# Terminal 3: Start the client interface
npm run start:client
```

### Usage
Once all services are running:
```
🎉 Client Worker ready!
💡 Type any prompt and press Enter to send it to the AI model
💡 Type "exit" to quit

> Write a haiku about technology
📤 Sending prompt: "Write a haiku about technology"
✅ AI Response:
Silicon dreams flow
Through circuits of endless light
Future awakens
```
