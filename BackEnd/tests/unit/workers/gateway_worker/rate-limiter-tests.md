## Implementation Guidelines

### What TO Test
✅ **Rate Limiting Business Logic**
- Request counting and decrementation
- Window expiration detection and reset
- Rate limit threshold enforcement
- Response structure generation
- Configuration parsing and application

✅ **Database Integration Logic**
- Database initialization and caching
- Record creation and updates
- Key generation and formatting
- Error handling and fail-open behavior

✅ **Time and Window Management**
- Timestamp comparisons
- Window expiration calculations
- Reset interval conversions
- Retry timing calculations

✅ **Input Validation and Edge Cases**
- Email parameter validation
- Configuration value handling
- Error scenario responses
- Boundary condition behavior

### What NOT to Test
❌ **External Library Behavior**
- Hyperbee database internal operations
- Store facility implementation details
- Environment variable system behavior

❌ **Infrastructure and Logging**
- console.error statements
- Database connection management
- File system operations

❌ **Observability Concerns**
- Metrics collection
- Performance monitoring
- Debug output

### Test Implementation Strategy
1. **Mock External Dependencies**: Mock database operations, time functions, environment variables
2. **Spy on Method Calls**: Verify correct parameters passed to database operations
3. **Test Business Logic Flow**: Validate decision points and calculations
4. **Error Path Coverage**: Test all error scenarios and fail-open behavior
5. **Time-based Testing**: Control timestamps for predictable window testing
6. **Independent Tests**: Each test isolated with proper setup/teardown

---

## Notes

- Focus only on RateLimiter business logic
- Do not test external library functionality (Hyperbee, store facility)
- Do not test logging behavior (console.error statements)
- Do not test actual time passage - use mocked timestamps
- Keep tests simple and easy to understand
- Each test should be independent
- Test both checkRateLimit and getRateLimitStatus for consistency
- Verify fail-open behavior in all error scenarios
- Test configuration handling thoroughly
- Cover all code paths and decision branches

---

## Final Implementation Notes

### Key Success Criteria
- All rate limiting calculations verified with exact parameter matching
- Database integration tested with correct key generation and data structures
- Error handling tested with appropriate fail-open behavior

### Testing Philosophy
Following the established pattern from other worker tests:
- **Simple and Plain**: Easy to read and understand
- **Business Logic Focus**: Test only what RateLimiter controls
- **Mock External Dependencies**: Don't test library behavior
- **Independent Tests**: Each test stands alone
- **Clear Assertions**: Straightforward pass/fail criteria
