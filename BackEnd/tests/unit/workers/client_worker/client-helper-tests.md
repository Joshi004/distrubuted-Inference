## Test Implementation Notes

### **Testing Priorities**
1. **Critical Path**: authorizedTopicRequest method, session management logic
2. **Error Handling**: All error scenarios and edge cases for each method
3. **Integration**: Method interactions and state consistency
4. **Edge Cases**: Parameter validation and boundary conditions

### **Mock Strategy**
- Mock all external dependencies (workerInstance.net_default, Math.random, setTimeout)
- Use sinon for spying on method calls and behavior verification
- Mock async operations to control timing and error scenarios
- Isolate business logic from console output (excluded from testing)

### **Test Data Requirements**
- Valid workerInstance objects with required properties
- Various data types for parameter testing
- Error objects for failure scenario testing
- Mock network responses for authorizedTopicRequest testing

### **Coverage Goals**
- 100% business logic coverage (excluding console output)
- All error paths and edge cases covered
- All method parameter combinations tested
- All state management scenarios tested
