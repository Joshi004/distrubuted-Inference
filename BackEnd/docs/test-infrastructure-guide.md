# 🧪 Test Infrastructure Guide

## 📋 Overview

We implemented a **comprehensive test suite** for our distributed AI inference platform using Brittle and Sinon.js. Our testing covers all workers, helpers, and external libraries with 496 tests ensuring system reliability and maintainability.

**Design Choice**: We use worker-specific test isolation with batch execution to prevent mock conflicts in our P2P distributed system.

## 🔧 Testing Framework

### **Core Technologies**
- **Test Framework**: Brittle (TAP-style, lightweight, async-friendly)
- **Mocking Library**: Sinon.js (stubs, spies, mocks for P2P components)
- **Test Runner**: Custom `run-all-tests.sh` script
- **Coverage**: 10 test files with 496 total tests

### **Why We Chose This Stack**
- **Brittle**: Already used by our facilities, excellent for async P2P testing
- **Sinon.js**: Essential for mocking DHT operations and RPC communication
- **Batch Execution**: Prevents module mocking conflicts between workers

## 📂 Test Structure

### **Directory Organization**
```
tests/
├── unit/
│   └── workers/
│       ├── auth_worker/
│       │   ├── auth-worker.test.js (1,553 lines)
│       │   └── auth-helper.test.js (914 lines)
│       ├── gateway_worker/
│       │   ├── gateway-worker.test.js
│       │   ├── gateway-helper.test.js  
│       │   └── rate-limiter.test.js
│       ├── processor_worker/
│       │   ├── processor-worker.test.js (2,255 lines)
│       │   └── processor-helper.test.js
│       └── client_worker/
│           ├── client-worker.test.js
│           └── client-helper.test.js
```

### **Test File Pattern**
Each worker has separate test files for:
- **Worker Class**: Constructor, lifecycle, RPC methods
- **Helper Class**: Business logic, data processing, external integrations

## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### **Run All Tests**
```bash
npm test
# or
./run-all-tests.sh
```

### **Run Specific Worker Tests**
```bash
# Processor worker tests
npm run test:processor

# Individual test files
npx brittle tests/unit/workers/auth_worker/auth-worker.test.js
npx brittle tests/unit/workers/gateway_worker/gateway-helper.test.js
```

### **Run in Batches** (Recommended)
Our test runner executes in 7 isolated batches to prevent mock conflicts:
1. **Helper Tests** - Shared helper functions
2. **Auth Worker Tests** - Authentication and JWT
3. **Gateway Tests** - Routing and rate limiting  
4. **Client Worker Tests** - Session management
5. **Processor Tests** - AI inference processing
6. **External Libraries** - DHT lookup and storage facilities

## 📊 Test Coverage

### **Current Test Statistics**
- **Total Tests**: 496 tests across all components
- **Test Files**: 10 comprehensive test files
- **Coverage Areas**: Workers, helpers, facilities, external libraries
- **Execution Time**: ~45 seconds for full suite

### **What We Test**
- **Worker Lifecycle**: Constructor, startup, shutdown, error handling
- **RPC Methods**: All exposed methods with success/error scenarios
- **Business Logic**: Authentication, rate limiting, AI processing
- **P2P Operations**: Service discovery, DHT operations (mocked)
- **External Integrations**: Ollama API, JWT, bcrypt, storage

## 🎭 Mocking Strategy

### **What We Mock**
- **SimpleMetrics**: Performance tracking to avoid side effects
- **SharedLogger**: Logging operations for clean test output
- **Network Facilities**: DHT operations and RPC communication
- **External APIs**: Ollama/AI service responses

### **What We Don't Mock**
- **Business Logic**: Real authentication, validation, data processing
- **Worker Classes**: Real constructor and method logic
- **Configuration**: Real config loading and merging



### **Mock Restoration**
Tests automatically restore mocks using Sinon's built-in cleanup and Brittle's teardown hooks.

## 📈 Test Execution Flow

### **Batch Execution Prevents Conflicts**
```bash
=== BATCH 1: Helper Tests ===
# Isolated helper function tests

=== BATCH 2: Auth Worker Tests ===
# Authentication and JWT tests

=== BATCH 3: Gateway Tests ===
# Request routing and rate limiting

# ... continues for all 7 batches
```

### **Summary Output**
```
Total Tests: 496/496 pass
All test files maintained and executed
```

## 🔍 Debugging Tests

### **Individual Test Execution**
```bash
# Run specific test with detailed output
npx brittle tests/unit/workers/auth_worker/auth-worker.test.js --verbose
```

### **Test File Inspection**
- **Large test files** (2,000+ lines) indicate comprehensive coverage
- **Test descriptions** clearly explain expected behavior
- **Assertion counts** show thorough validation

## ⚡ Quick Testing Commands

### **Development Workflow**
```bash
# Quick test of specific component
npx brittle tests/unit/workers/gateway_worker/gateway-helper.test.js

# Full test suite
npm test

# Check test file structure
find tests/ -name "*.test.js" | wc -l
```

### **Continuous Integration**
The test runner provides proper exit codes for CI/CD integration and produces TAP-compatible output for test result parsing.

## 🎉 Summary

We built a robust test infrastructure that:

✅ **Comprehensive Coverage** - 496 tests across all system components  
✅ **P2P-Aware Testing** - Proper mocking of DHT and RPC operations  
✅ **Isolated Execution** - Batch system prevents mock conflicts  
✅ **Developer Friendly** - Clear test patterns and easy execution  
✅ **CI/CD Ready** - Proper exit codes and TAP output format  
✅ **Performance Focused** - Fast execution with efficient mocking  

This test infrastructure ensures our distributed AI inference platform remains reliable and maintainable as it evolves.
