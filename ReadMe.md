# ü§ñ Distributed AI Inference Platform

A P2P distributed AI inference system with microservices architecture. Users interact with AI models through web UI, CLI, or API interfaces backed by secure authentication and intelligent routing.

## üìã Quick Reference Guide

This README serves as a navigation hub to all project documentation. The platform consists of:
- **Frontend**: React web application with Material-UI
- **Backend**: Four P2P worker services (Auth, Gateway, Processor, Client)
- **External**: Ollama AI service for model inference

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**: Node.js, npm, Ollama with Llama3 model
2. **Install**: `npm install` in both BackEnd and FrontEnd directories
3. **Start Backend**: Run auth, gateway, processor, and client workers
4. **Start Frontend**: Launch React development server
5. **Access**: Web UI at http://localhost:3000 or use CLI client

For detailed setup instructions, see [SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md).

## üîß Technology Stack

**Backend:**
- Node.js with Hyperswarm P2P networking
- Ollama/Llama3 for AI inference
- bcrypt + JWT for authentication
- Prometheus for metrics
- Brittle + Sinon for testing

**Frontend:**
- React 18 with Material-UI (MUI) v5
- React Router for navigation
- Axios for HTTP communication
- Context API for state management

## üîê Security Features

- JWT-based authentication with 24-hour expiration
- Rate limiting (10 requests/minute per user)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- P2P network security with encrypted communication

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

## üìÅ Project Structure Design

We have made a deliberate design choice to keep both frontend and backend in the same repository for ease of cloning, sharing, and development. This monorepo approach simplifies setup and ensures version compatibility between all components.
